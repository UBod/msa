# msa: An R Package for Multiple Sequence Alignment
The 'msa' package provides a unified R/Bioconductor interface to
the multiple sequence alignment algorithms ClustalW, ClustalOmega,
and Muscle. All three algorithms are integrated in the package,
therefore, they do not depend on any external software tools
and are available for all major platforms. The multiple sequence
alignment algorithms are complemented by a function for
pretty-printing multiple sequence alignments using the LaTeX
package TeXshade.

This is the source code repository. The package can be installed from
[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/msa.html).
Further information and installation instructions are also available from
http://www.bioinf.jku.at/software/msa/.

Although the package is maintained by Ulrich Bodenhofer, the package itself
has been implemented mainly by Enrico Bonatesta and Christoph Kainrath-Horejs.
