/* Function: PositionBasedWeights()
 * Date:     SRE, Fri Jul 16 17:47:22 1999 [St. Louis]
 *
 * Purpose:  Implementation of Henikoff and Henikoff position-based
 *           weights (JMB 243:574-578, 1994) [Henikoff94b].
 *           
 *           A significant advantage of this approach that Steve and Jorja
 *           don't point out is that it is O(N) in memory, unlike
 *           many other approaches like GSC weights or Voronoi.
 *           
 *           A potential disadvantage that they don't point out
 *           is that in the theoretical limit of infinite sequences
 *           in the alignment, weights go flat: eventually every
 *           column has at least one representative of each of 20 aa (or 4 nt)
 *           in it.
 *           
 *           They also don't give a rule for how to handle gaps.
 *           The rule used here seems the obvious and sensible one
 *           (ignore them). This means that longer sequences
 *           initially get more weight; hence a "double
 *           normalization" in which the weights are first divided
 *           by sequence length (to compensate for that effect),
 *           then normalized to sum to nseq.
 *           
 * Limitations:
 *           Implemented in a way that's alphabet-independent:
 *           it uses the 26 upper case letters as "residues".
 *           Any alphabetic character in aseq is interpreted as
 *           a unique "residue" (case insensitively; lower case
 *           mapped to upper case). All other characters are
 *           interpreted as gaps.
 *           
 *           This way, we don't have to pass around any alphabet
 *           type info (DNA vs. RNA vs. protein) and don't have
 *           to deal with remapping IUPAC degenerate codes
 *           probabilistically. However, on the down side,
 *           a sequence with a lot of degenerate IUPAC characters
 *           will get an artifactually high PB weight.
 *           
 * Args:     aseq   - sequence alignment to weight
 *           nseq   - number of sequences in alignment
 *           alen   - length of alignment
 *           wgt    - RETURN: weights filled in (pre-allocated 0..nseq-1)

/* Function: SampleAlignment()
 * Date:     SRE, Wed Jun 30 10:13:56 1999 [St. Louis]
 * 
 * Purpose:  Constructs a new, smaller alignment by sampling a given
 *           number of sequences at random. Does not change the
 *           alignment nor the order of the sequences.
 *           
 *           If you ask for a sample that is larger than nseqs,
 *           it silently returns the original alignment.
 *           
 *           Not really a weighting method, but this is as good
 *           a place as any to keep it, since it's similar in
 *           construction to FilterAlignment().
 *           
 * Args:     msa      -- original alignment
 *           sample   -- number of sequences in new alignment (0 < sample <= nseq)
 *           ret_new  -- RETURN: new MSA 
 *                         
 * Return:   (void)
 *           ret_new must be free'd by caller: MSAFree().

/* Function: SingleLinkCluster()
 * Date:     SRE, Fri Jul 16 15:02:57 1999 [St. Louis]
 *
 * Purpose:  Perform simple single link clustering of seqs in a
 *           sequence alignment. A pairwise identity threshold
 *           defines whether two sequences are linked or not.
 *           
 *           Important: runs in O(N) memory, unlike standard
 *           graph decomposition algorithms that use O(N^2)
 *           adjacency matrices or adjacency lists. Requires
 *           O(N^2) time in worst case (which is when you have
 *           no links at all), O(NlogN) in "average"
 *           case, and O(N) in best case (when there is just
 *           one cluster in a completely connected graph.
 *           
 *           (Developed because hmmbuild could no longer deal
 *           with GP120, a 16,013 sequence alignment.)
 *           
 * Limitations: 
 *           CASE-SENSITIVE. Assumes aseq have been put into
 *           either all lower or all upper case; or at least,
 *           within a column, there's no mixed case.
 *           
 * Algorithm: 
 *           I don't know if this algorithm is published. I 
 *           haven't seen it in graph theory books, but that might
 *           be because it's so obvious that nobody's bothered.
 *           
 *           In brief, we're going to do a breadth-first search
 *           of the graph, and we're going to calculate links
 *           on the fly rather than precalculating them into
 *           some sort of standard adjacency structure.
 *           
 *           While working, we keep two stacks of maximum length N:
 *                a : list of vertices that are still unconnected.
 *                b : list of vertices that we've connected to 
 *                    in our current breadth level, but we haven't
 *                    yet tested for other connections to a.
 *           The current length (number of elements in) a and b are
 *           kept in na, nb.
 *                    
 *           We store our results in an array of length N:
 *                c : assigns each vertex to a component. for example
 *                    c[4] = 1 means that vertex 4 is in component 1.
 *                    nc is the number of components. Components
 *                    are numbered from 0 to nc-1. We return c and nc
 *                    to our caller.
 *                    
 *           The algorithm is:
 *           
 *           Initialisation: 
 *                a  <-- all the vertices
 *                na <-- N
 *                b  <-- empty set
 *                nb <-- 0
 *                nc <-- 0
 *                
 *           Then:
 *                while (a is not empty)
 *                  pop a vertex off a, push onto b
 *                  while (b is not empty)
 *                    pop vertex v off b
 *                    assign c[v] = nc
 *                    for each vertex w in a:
 *                       compare v,w. If w is linked to v, remove w
 *                       from a, push onto b.
 *                  nc++     
 *           q.e.d. :)
