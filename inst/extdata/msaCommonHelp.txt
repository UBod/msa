For consistency with the R/Bioconductor platform, some parameters were renamed
(as compared to the names in the algorithms' original implementation).
Note: all parameter names are case-sensitive!
To show all choices for character arguments, supply an empty string "". Then 
the function prints all options for this parameter.
Furthermore, until now, not all functionalities are realized. A more 
sophisticated implementation (and help) will be available in the subsequent 
version.
